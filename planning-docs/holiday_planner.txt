DESIGN



tutorial:
how to write JSON and save locally from a web app


You should first convert the JSON object that you build in your program to a string using JSON.stringify.  
Then write this string to a file using the writeTextAsync methods in FileIO.  To reverse the process, read the file to a string and then convert back to a JSON object using JSON.parse.
(I would just use a .txt extension for the file.)
